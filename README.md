  # Installation

  Run to install the inquirer module:
    
    npm i inquirer 

  ## Usage

  Create README files of current and future products.

  ## Description

  This project was created to help users create README files by inputting data through the terminal. This data then is added to the correct spot of the markdown. When questions finsh being asked, the generateMarkdown module is called, which creates the structure of the README and inputs user data answered from questions. The README.md file then appears in the repository file.

  Technologies used include node.js modules (fs), third-party modules (inquirer), and user created modules (generateMarkdown). Separating modules allows the program to do less computing and focus on specific tasks synchronously. A template literal was created to allow user responses to populate specific parts of the README file.
