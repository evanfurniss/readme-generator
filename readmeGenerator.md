    # Installation
    Add later I guess when I think I understand this better.
    ## Usage
    Input specified values using the terminal, which creates a README file for the described project.
    ## Description
    This project was designed to assist devs in creating a workable README template. The user will input all necessary information asked following the prompts. Node.js and inquirer take that information and return the value of the variable when called. The built in node feature 'fs' allow the user to create and manipulate files easily, using the users inputs.
    ## Contribution
